    // to offset the affect updating the yaw has on rotating the player model, which
    // would create a positive feedback loop and constantly create a rotation if your
    // head isn't exactly centered.

    // sets the direction of the player's gaze. This is important because what the player is
    // looking at is used when computing a lot of things, such as what is
    // rendered on screen plus some other gameplay related things (such as controlling what
    // the player is trying to interact with). So if we don't match these rotations, when
    // the player looks in a direction that doesn't match the m_eye rotation, things get weird,
    // ...ie disappearing trees and all kinds of graphical glitches.

    // Since originally the method was being used to set the eye rotation (and then
    // eye rotation used to set m_lookDir), we'll update the Player GameObject rotation
    // to equal to current yaw from mouse input. That way, due to the SetMouseLook patch,
    // m_lookDir will get the value of the updated player body direction plus of course the
    // side effect of the body rotation being directly controlled by the mouse (or whatever
    // input that will be used).
